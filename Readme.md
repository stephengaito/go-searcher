# Go-Searcher

A simple GoLang/SQLite3 tool to provide a local search engine to a
collection of static HTML files.

See:

- [Go Web Examples - Learn Web Programming in Go by
  Examples](https://gowebexamples.com/)

- [GitHub - mmcdole/gofeed: Parse RSS and Atom feeds in
  Go](https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed)

- [kennygrant/sanitize: Package sanitize provides functions for sanitizing
  text in golang strings.](https://github.com/kennygrant/sanitize)

- [microcosm-cc/bluemonday: bluemonday: a fast golang HTML sanitizer
  (inspired by the OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer) to scrub user generated content
  of XSS](https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday)

- [umputun/remark: comment engine](https://github.com/umputun/remark)
  (Has RSS/Atom feed for potential indexing by go-searcher)

- [A fast, privacy-focused commenting platform](https://www.commento.io/)
  (Simpler than Remark42 but would need RSS/Atom feeds to be added)
